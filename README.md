# Yesterday's note

![yesterdays-note-thumbnail](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b24304c-b7f9-4e56-aa01-4e144adb52bc)

This plugin adds a command to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to open yesterday's daily note. If the note does not exist, the plugin can create it for you.

## Features
- Adds a ribbon icon which opens yesterday's daily note when clicked.
- Adds a command "Yesterday's note" which opens yesterday's daily note.

## FAQ

**Why don't you use the "Open previous daily note" command?**

The `Open previous daily note` command is only available when a daily note is focused in the editor. This means to open yesterday's daily note, you must enter two commands: `Open today's daily note` -> `Open previous daily note`. Also, the two commands aren't exactly the sameâ€”one references the note for yesterday's date and the other references the note that comes before the current note.
